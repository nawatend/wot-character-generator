# Project Characters

####  An application with which a visitor (client) can generate a "character" in real time via a web application using an UI (User Interface). The user can go into real-time mode, or simply create the character. The created character can be stored in a database. The client runs on GitHub pages and uses Google Firebase. The Raspberry Pi runs a program that can anticipate changes within Google Firebase Realtime Database or Google Firebase Firestore.
